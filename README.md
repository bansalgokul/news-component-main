## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS basics

### What I learned

I did not learn something completely new to me. But I had to spend a lot of time thinking and drawing about the grid layout and flexbox layout to position all elements. It improved my proficiency with adding and removing css classes to manipulate the page using js. I also practiced BEM naming convention in this project that decreased the difficulty for me significantly. Also designing the nav bar was a good experience for future projects. All in all, it was worth the time and work it required and suited perfectly for my level. Cheers !
